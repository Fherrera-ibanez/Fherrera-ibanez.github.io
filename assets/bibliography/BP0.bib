	abstract = {This paper addresses to some of the latest contributions on the application of Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC) in Power Electronics. In FCS-MPC , the switching states are directly applied to the power converter, without the need of an additional modulation stage. The paper shows how the use of FCS-MPC provides a simple and efficient computational realization for different control objectives in Power Electronics. Some applications of this technology in drives, active filters, power conditioning, distributed generation and renewable energy are covered. Finally, attention is paid to the discussion of new trends in this technology and to the identification of open questions and future research topics.},

	abstract = {In this work, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy based on optimal switching sequence (OSS) concepts is proposed for a grid-connected three-level neutral-point clamped converter. The proposed cascaded-OSS-MPC strategy does not require a weighting factor to balance the dc-link capacitor voltages and optimally controls both the grid currents and the capacitor voltages even during disturbances and large step changes in the references. The resulting MPC strategy allows operating the converter with a predefined harmonic spectrum, fixed switching frequency, and fast and robust dynamic response. Besides, an efficient optimization algorithm is also introduced to reduce the computational burden typically observed in this kind of MPC strategies. Experimental and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of the proposed strategy.},
