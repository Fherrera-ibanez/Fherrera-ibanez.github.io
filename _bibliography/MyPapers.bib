	abstract = {In some applications of microgrids and distributed generation, it is necessary to feed islanded or stand-alone loads with high-quality voltage to provide low total harmonic distortion (THD). To fulfil these demands, an LC filter is usuallyconnected to the output terminals of power electronics converters. A cascaded voltage and current control loop with pulse-width modulation schemes are used to regulate the voltages and currents in these systems. However, these strategies have some drawbacks, particularly when multiple-input–multiple-output plants (MIMO) are controlled using single-input–single-output (SISO) design methods. This methodology usually produces a sluggish transient response and cross–coupling between different control loops and state variables. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy based on the concept of optimal switching sequences (OSS) is designed to control voltage and current in an LC filter connected to a three-level neutral-point clamped converter. The strategy solves an optimisation problem to achieve control of the LC filter variables, i.e., currents and output voltages. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) results are obtained to validate the feasibility of the proposed strategy, using a PLECS–RT HIL platform and a dSPACE Microlab Box controller. In addition to the good dynamic performance of the proposed OSS–MPC, it is demonstrated using HIL results that the control algorithm is capable of obtaining low total harmonic distortion (THD) in the output voltage for different operating conditions.},

The method applies three voltage space vectors at every sampling period and the duty cycles are computed using the cost function. The current errors along with the voltage drift of the neutral-point are the control criteria, whereas the switching frequency is constant and defined by the sampling period. Simulations results validates this proposal showing quick response and good current tracking.},

	abstract = {Modular multilevel converters are a family of converters proposed for high-voltage and high-power applications. The hexverter topology was introduced as a direct AC-to-AC converter with a reduced number of clusters compared to other multilevel topologies. The control of the hexverter is complex and requires several stages. One of these stages, the balancing of the floating capacitor voltages, necessitates precise regulation of the converter's circulating currents. In this paper, a model predictive control strategy is proposed to regulate the circulating current of the hexverter. Simulation results demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed controller.},
